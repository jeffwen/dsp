[Think Stats Chapter 9 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2010.html#toc90) (resampling)

>> P-Value (Pregnancy Length Resample): 0.142

>> Compared to the P-Value of 17% with the permutation method, there is not a huge difference between the two methods of sampling.

>> P-Value (Birth Weight Resample): 0.00

>> Similarly the P-Value for the Birth Weight Resample did not change much as compared to the permutation method.
