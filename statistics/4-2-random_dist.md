[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> It seems like the random number generator is close to random as the PMF shows nearly a solid uniform distribution of random values each with probability of 1/1000 or .001 of occurring. Additionally, the CDF shows an almost straight line meaning that the distribution of random numbers appears to almost be uniform.
